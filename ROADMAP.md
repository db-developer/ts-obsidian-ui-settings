# Roadmap

This roadmap outlines planned features, improvements, and long-term goals for the **ts-obsidian-ui-settings** framework.

---

## Short-term Goals (Next Release Cycle)

- Complete unit test coverage for all core classes and types
- Add examples for complex sub-tab interactions
- Improve documentation and API reference
- Enhance TypeScript type safety for nested sub-tabs and settings
- Introduce helper utilities for common sub-tab patterns

---

## Mid-term Goals

- Provide built-in support for dynamic sub-tab loading
- Implement optional persistent tab state across plugin reloads
- Offer theming options for tab navigation buttons
- Add more examples and templates for plugin developers

---

## Long-term Goals

- Support fully pluggable sub-tab layouts
- Integrate with other Obsidian plugin ecosystems
- Provide a CLI or generator to scaffold settings tabs
- Enable advanced type-level validation for plugin settings and dependencies
- Explore support for internationalized sub-tab headers and dynamic translations

---

## Notes

- All development will maintain full TypeScript compatibility.
- No external runtime dependencies will be introduced, to remain fully bundleable in Obsidian plugins.
- Sub-tabs will remain isolated and reusable across plugins.
